        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <p>
          This project developed a health-based action toolkit to help stakeholders and the public
          understand and prevent lead contamination in drinking water. The toolkit translates research
          into accessible resources for families, youth, and decision-makers, including educational
          infographics, a cartoon PSA, youth-friendly materials, planning tools such as logic models
          and a stakeholder matrix, and compiled databases of practical resources.

        <h3>Key Facts on Lead Contamination</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No safe level of exposure.</strong> Lead cannot be detected by sight, smell, or taste.</li>
          <li><strong>Primary sources</strong> include aging infrastructure — lead service lines, lead solder, and brass fixtures common in homes built before 1952.</li>
          <li><strong>Health impacts</strong> are wide-ranging: lead accumulates in bones and teeth and is linked to cognitive and behavioural issues, cardiovascular disease, and kidney dysfunction. Infants and children are especially vulnerable.</li>
          <li><strong>Testing is the only way to confirm contamination.</strong> If lead is present, use certified filters, avoid hot tap water for consumption, and consult your municipality about service line replacement.</li>
        </ul>
