        <h3>Report on Local Governance Structures in Canada</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Local governance</strong> plays a vital role in the daily lives of Canadians,
          forming the foundation for the resilience and sustainability of Canadian democracy.
          Despite this importance, there remains a lack of reliable and comprehensive public
          data on local democracy. As a result, local governance remains poorly understood by
          both academics and the public.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>GLOCAL Foundation of Canada</strong> seeks to bridge this gap by conducting
          extensive research into the complexity and diversity of local governance structures
          across the country. This initiative draws primarily from the <em>Acts and
          regulations</em> of each province and territory, supplemented with official sources such
          as provincial and municipal websites and regional associations.
