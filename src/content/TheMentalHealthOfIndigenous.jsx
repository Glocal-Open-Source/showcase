        <h3>About Sara</h3>
        <p>My name is Sara Saadat. I&#x27;m 23 years old, and I&#x27;m from Afghanistan. I came to Canada with my family in 2021. Currently, I&#x27;m an undergraduate student studying commerce. I recently discovered GLOCAL and its projects, which I find very useful as a newcomer in Canada. They help me develop my skills in various areas and be active in the community. Right now.</p>
